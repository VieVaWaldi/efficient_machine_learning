# Efficient Machine Learning 

Hello, each task in the assignments are their own self contained project and have a README.

**/1st_chapter:** Steppest Descent and optimization

**/2nd_chapter:** No tasks that can be shown here but i started a job on ookami in chapter 3 :)

**/3d_chapter:** Tensors and MLP aus Kapitel 3

**/4th_chapter:** Pytorch und C++ Extensions aus Kapitel 4
* 4.2 und 4.3 is WIP

**/5th_chapter:** Linear Layers on Steroids

* 5.1 und 5.2 were provided by you
* 5.3 was just pushed, attached are the images to the benchmarks

**/6th_chapter:** Convolutional Layers

* 6.2 and 6.3, code is running the test, but the tests are failing :(

**/7th_chapter:** Distributed Deep Learning

* 7.1 in 7_1_task
* 7.2 in mlp_fashion_mnist. Results in RESULTS_7_2.md
