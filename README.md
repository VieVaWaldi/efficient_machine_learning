# Efficient Machine Learning 

Hello, each task in the assignments are their own self contained project and have a README.

**/1st_chapter:** Steppest Descent and optimization

**/2nd_chapter:** No tasks that can be shown here but i started a job on ookami in chapter 3 :)

**/3d_chapter:** Tensors and MLP aus Kapitel 3

**/4th_chapter:** Pytorch und C++ Extensions aus Kapitel 4
* 4.2 und 4.3 is WIP

**/5th_chapter:** Linear Layers on Steroids

* 5.1 und 5.2 were provided by you
* 5.3 was just pushed, attached are the images to the benchmarks

**/6th_chapter:** Convolutional Layers

* 6.2 and 6.3, code is running the test, but the tests are failing :(

**/7th_chapter:** Distributed Deep Learning

* 7.1 in 7_1_task
* 7.2 in mlp_fashion_mnist. Results in RESULTS_7_2.md

**/8th_chapter:** Seismic Facies Identification

* Grid search in ```8th_chapter```, as well as unet for gpus with adaptive learning rate in ```unet_seismic```, and in ```unet_seismic_mpi``` a distributed versions for multiple cpus.
* Csv results with set parameters in ```csv```, and model as well as job outputs in ```finished_runs```.
* ```grid_unet_slurm.jobs``` starts a job for the python script ```grid_search_unet.py```, which starts jobs for each given config.
* The written results as well as colleced csv's can be accessed here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_nF_B8RYWzZm-Y12cWkUOkggTKbpNgG7?usp=sharing
