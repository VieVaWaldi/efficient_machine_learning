# Hello

### Aufgabe 3.2 Multilayer Perceptron

In directory ```/2nd_assignment/eml```, run ```python3 main.py``` to start the model, evaluation and visualization.

Pdfs are under ```/2nd_assignment/data/pdf```, as is the result of the batch job. Though i pretrained the model locally and just continued training on okami, i hope thats not a problem.

Some answers are also in the python doc, like what batch_size does to the data loader, e.g. in ```/2nd_assignment/data/FashionMnist/fashion_mnist_data.py```, appended to the method docs. This will also be printed to console.
